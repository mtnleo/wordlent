## 🤷 How to play?

⚪ Means the letter is **not in the word**

🟡 Means the letter is in the word but in a **different position**

🟢 Means the letter is in the word in that **exact position**!

🔴 Means the word is **not contemplated** in-game

## Functionality

💭 It used to implement an API model to retrieve the words but a simple txt with the words choosing randomly did it, 
so there was no need to further complicate the functionality.
